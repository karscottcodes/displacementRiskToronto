The purpose of this capstone project is to develop a Displacement Risk Map for the City of Toronto, inspired by the initiativce in New York City ( [Found Here](https://equitableexplorer.planning.nyc.gov/map/data/districthttp:// "Found Here") ). The project aims to illustrate the level of risk residents face regarding the ability to remain in their home or community.

By analyzing various factors, such as building types, demographics, taxes, access to amenities, and rental vacancy rates, the project will provide valuable insights into the risk across the different neighbourhoods of Toronto.
